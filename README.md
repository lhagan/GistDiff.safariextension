**Note:** _this extension is now obsolete since GitHub has added native diff functionality in the recent Gist redesign. I'm leaving this repo up for future reference, but it's no longer maintained and will not work._

# [Gist Diff](https://raw.github.com/lhagan/GistDiff.safariextension/master/GistDiff.safariextz)

This Safari extension is a port of the [Chrome extension](https://github.com/NV/diff-for-gist.github), which is in turn a direct port of Greasemonkey script "[Diff for gist.github](https://github.com/ucnv/diff-for-gist.github)".

Download the extension [here](https://raw.github.com/lhagan/GistDiff.safariextension/master/GistDiff.safariextz).
